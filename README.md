# Spring Boot - Project

This application sets up a "student" database, implements CRUD operations on it and posts in a JSON format on an HTTP localhost web page.    

### **Technologies used:**  
Spring Boot, Postman, Spring Web, Spring Data JPA, PostgreSQL, SQL shell, IntelliJ.  

PostgreSQL - for creating a rational database.  
Postman - for testing the client side, sending Get/Post/Put/Delete requests and viewing the responses: 

### Introduction:  
After boostrapping a Spring Boot application using Spring Initializer and adding the dependencies (Spring Web, Spring Data JPA, PostgreSQL Driver), we created 5 classes:  
* Student - @Entity, represents a student in the table (see below).  
* StudentController - @RestController & @RequestMapping, serves as the API Layer for CRUD operations.  
* StudentService - @Service, serves as the Service (business) Layer, implementing those CRUD operations on the database.  
* StudentRepository - @Repository, part of the Data Access Layer, checking that a student's email appears only one before creating a new entry.  
* StudentConfig - @Configuration, part of the Data Access Layer, creating students entities and saving them in the repository.  


### **Student Entity fields:**
* Id (primary key) - generated by @SequenceGenerator starting from 1.  
* Name - is given as an input.  
* Email - is given as an input.  
* Date of birth -is given as an input.    
* Age - generated by @Transient.  





### **How To Run The Project:**  
1. Clone the project: https://github.com/Kineruth/spring-boot-project.git .  
2. Connect to "student" database using ```\c student``` on SQL Shell:   
3. Run the application on your IDE.  
4. Go to (URL) http://localhost:8080/api/v1/student on your web browser.
